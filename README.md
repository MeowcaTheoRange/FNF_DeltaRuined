# Friday Night Funkin' - DeltaRuined
Engine is Psych Engine, intended to be a skin for this engine's unchanged look.

## Installation:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

For all of your funny annoying needs! Sadly unchangeable without changing Source Code. May be fixed soon.

## New UI

Duh. Why not?
